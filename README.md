# PyDMC REST API Client for Python

The Digital Marketing Center API makes it possible for you to
connect any program or webpage to your email marketing platform.
That lets you pull data into DMC and extract information for reuse
in other applications.

Combined with our standard automation functionality, the API makes
it easy to set up and manage an email marketing campaign. Using our
API creates extremely powerful opportunities for tailoring marketing
tools and Web sites to your specific client communication needs.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the installation script by typing `python setup.py install`. Easy!

## Usage

Once this module is installed, you can import and use it as you would any
other Python module:

"""
import pydmc
dmc = PyDmc(apiUser,apiPass,apiUrl)
"""

## Caveat Emptor

This module is by no means complete. It is being updated incrementally based
on internal TDI needs, so it may not do what you want it to just yet.

Feedback and improvements are welcomed and encouraged.
